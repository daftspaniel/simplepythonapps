# Simple Python Apps

A collection of well commented Python apps for learning or customisation. The apps are written in Python 3 and Tkinter which are commonly available.

## Why?

Sometimes you just need an app for a particular purpose and tracking one down, learning and customising it is far more effort than a short 20 line app to do *exactly* what you want the way you want it done.

Suggestions welcome!

## Apps

1. Clock - a super simple clock.
2. Scratchpad - a small text window that saves the text automatically.
3. News - terminal app that shows a random story from the newsboat RSS reader database.
